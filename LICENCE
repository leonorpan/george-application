Don't know yet.


I would like:
- this software to be free to use in its originally distributed form (from me)
- allow anyone to download the source code for the purpose of inspection, study,  modification for experimentation and contribution
- not allow redistribution - either as a derivative or as part of their own software
- only bundled in its original form pr agreement with me

Comments?  Suggestions?
